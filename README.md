# Movies-ETL

### Introduction
The ETL process runs through the data, extracting, transforming and loading the information into a new clean dataset for usage. In this challenge we automated the pipline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations and loads the data into existing tables. The provided function will perform all three etl steps on the Wikipedia and Kaggle data. The resulting information can then be analyzed.
